You can reposition them and reuse them as you please. They don't even leave any residue after they're gone. You can write on these stickers, or let their looks speak for themselves. The company started out making sticky ties, but have continued adding new shapes and themes to the line-up. Our personal favorite is the bow tie. Try these at your next party and see how they liven up even a plain white tee."

Now thanks to PhoneSoap, there's an easy and highly effective way to zap the microbes off your phone. PhoneSoap is a charger for your smartphone that encloses it in a UV case, which emits light in the UV-C range that kills 99.99% of bacteria. It disinfects your phone it just 5 minutes, but it's also safe to leave it in there all night while it charges too. You'll still be able to hear any notifications through the built-in audio amplifier. One of the advantages of the PhoneSoap charger over other products, such as anti-bacterial wipes for wireless devices, is that it's a one-time investment. You'll be able to use the charger again and again without having to reorder or spend more money. You also won't even need to remember to wipe your phone, since you'll be charging it either way.
